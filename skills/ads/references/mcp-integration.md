# MCP Integration Guide

<!-- Created: 2026-04-13 | v1.5 -->
<!-- Purpose: How to pair codex-ads with live ad platform MCP servers -->

## Overview

codex-ads defaults to Computer Use-assisted read-only inspection when the user
is logged into an ad dashboard and asks for live account analysis. For API-level
access, pair it with MCP servers that connect Codex CLI directly to ad platform
APIs. Manual exports, screenshots, and pasted metrics remain supported fallback
inputs.

## Available MCP Servers

### Google Ads: cohnen/mcp-google-ads

**Repo:** https://github.com/cohnen/mcp-google-ads
**Stars:** ~395 | **Tools:** 29 GAQL-based tools

**Setup:**
1. Install: `pip install mcp-google-ads` (or clone repo)
2. Configure Google Ads API credentials (OAuth2 or service account) — use a **read-only OAuth scope** for audit work
3. **Before adding credentials to `.mcp.json`, do this first:**
   - Add `.mcp.json` to your project's `.gitignore` so the file never reaches a public repo
   - Set restrictive file permissions: `chmod 600 .mcp.json` on Unix/macOS
   - Export the credentials into your shell as environment variables (so they live in your OS keychain / `.bashrc` / `~/.config`, not in a project file):
     ```bash
     export GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN="..."
     export GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID="..."
     export GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET="..."
     export GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN="..."
     export GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID="..."
     ```
4. Reference the env vars in `.mcp.json` so the file itself contains no secrets:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "google-ads": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "mcp_google_ads"],
      "env": {
        "GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN": "${GOOGLE_ADS_DEVELOPER_TOKEN}",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID": "${GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_ID}",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET": "${GOOGLE_ADS_CLIENT_SECRET}",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN": "${GOOGLE_ADS_REFRESH_TOKEN}",
        "GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID": "${GOOGLE_ADS_LOGIN_CUSTOMER_ID}"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> ⚠ **Why this matters.** A Google Ads refresh token + client secret + developer token is a full-account credential bundle. Committing `.mcp.json` with inline secrets to a public repo gives every reader long-lived API access. The `${VAR}` form keeps the file itself safe to commit if needed.

**What becomes automated:**
- Search term data for G13, G16, G17, G18, G19 (wasted spend checks)
- Quality Score data for G20-G25
- Campaign structure for G01-G12
- Conversion tracking status for G42-G49
- PMax asset group data for G31-G34, G-PM1 through G-PM6
- Budget and bidding data for G36-G41

**What stays manual:**
- Landing page analysis (G59-G61): use `analyze_landing.py`
- Creative quality assessment (subjective)
- Consent Mode V2 verification (requires GTM/tag audit)

### Meta Ads: Adspirer MCP

**Docs:** https://www.adspirer.com/blog/connect-codex-meta-ads
**Type:** Commercial MCP server

**Setup:**
1. Sign up at adspirer.com
2. Connect Meta Business Manager account
3. Add MCP server config per their docs

**What becomes automated:**
- Campaign performance data for M11-M18 (structure)
- Creative metrics for M25-M32 (fatigue detection)
- Audience overlap for M19 (overlap check)
- EMQ scores for M04 (requires Events Manager access)

**Alternative: Direct Meta API:**
No bundled fetcher ships with codex-ads. For a free, self-hosted option, write
a thin wrapper around the Meta Marketing API (Graph API) and import its JSON
output via the standard data-collection flow.

### LinkedIn Ads: Multiple Options

**GrowthSpree MCP:** https://www.growthspreeofficial.com/blogs/connect-linkedin-ads-to-codex-mcp
**Adzviser MCP:** https://adzviser.com/mcp/linkedin-ads

Both provide campaign data access for LinkedIn Ads analysis. Setup follows standard MCP patterns.

### TikTok Ads

No dedicated MCP server available as of April 2026. Use:
- TikTok Ads Manager exports (CSV)
- TikTok Business API (custom integration via scripts)

### Microsoft Ads

No dedicated MCP server available as of April 2026. Use:
- Microsoft Ads Editor exports
- Google Ads import data (if mirrored)
- Microsoft Advertising API (custom integration)

### Apple Ads

No dedicated MCP server available as of April 2026. Use:
- Apple Ads dashboard exports
- Apple Ads API (custom integration)

## Hybrid Workflow

The recommended approach combines live UI inspection, MCP live data, and
codex-ads structured analysis:

```
1. If the user is logged in, inspect the ad dashboard with Computer Use in read-only mode
2. Connect MCP server(s) for available platforms when API-level data is useful
3. Run /ads audit (codex-ads combines UI observations, MCP data, and provided files)
4. For platforms without live access, provide exports manually
5. codex-ads merges all data into unified audit
6. Health Score calculated across all platforms regardless of data source
```

## Security Notes

- **MCP servers run locally** — no data leaves your machine except the API calls each server makes to its target ad platform.
- **Never inline credentials in committed files.** Add `.mcp.json` to `.gitignore`, set `chmod 600 .mcp.json` on Unix, and use `${ENV_VAR}` interpolation so the file contains references — not values. See the Google Ads setup above for the canonical pattern; the same applies to Meta, LinkedIn, and any future MCP server.
- **Use read-only OAuth scopes** for audit work. A refresh token issued for `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/adwords` allows campaign mutations; for audit-only the read scope is sufficient.
- **Rotate any token that was ever committed to a public repo**, even briefly. Treat the credential as compromised — search-engine caches and forks make deletion unreliable.
- **For write operations** (campaign changes, budget edits), see the CEP safety protocol discussion in the itallstartedwithaidea/google-ads-skills repo. Codex Ads itself is audit-only by design.
